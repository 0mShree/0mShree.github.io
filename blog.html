                <h2>Our Ranking</h2>
                <p>Among overall rankings, the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) has ranked Harvard as the
                    world's top university every year since it was released.[98] When QS and Times Higher Education
                    collaborated to publish the Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings from 2004 to 2009,
                    Harvard held the top spot every year and continued to hold first place on THE World Reputation
                    Rankings ever since it was released in 2011. In 2019, it was ranked first worldwide by SCImago
                    Institutions Rankings. It was ranked in the first tier of American research universities, along
                    with Columbia, MIT, and Stanford, in the 2019 report from the Center for Measuring University
                    Performance. Harvard University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher
                    Education.

                <p>
                    Among rankings of specific indicators, Harvard topped both the University Ranking by Academic
                    Performance (2019–2020) and Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities (2011),
                    which measured universities' numbers of alumni holding CEO positions in Fortune Global 500
                    companies. According to annual polls done by The Princeton Review, Harvard is consistently
                    among the top two most commonly named dream colleges in the United States, both for students and
                    parents. Additionally, having made significant investments in its engineering school
                    in recent years, Harvard was ranked third worldwide for Engineering and Technology in 2019 by Times
                    Higher Education.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Harvard is a founding member of the Association of American Universities and a preeminent
                    research university with "very high" research activity and comprehensive doctoral programs
                    across the arts, sciences, engineering, and medicine according to the Carnegie Classification.

                    With the medical school consistently ranking first among medical schools for research,
                    biomedical research is an area of particular strength for the university. More than 11,000 faculty
                    and over 1,600 graduate students conduct research at the medical school as well as its 15 affiliated
                    hospitals and research institutes. The medical school and its affiliates attracted $1.65 billion
                    in competitive research grants from the National Institutes of Health in 2019, more than twice as
                    much as any other university.
